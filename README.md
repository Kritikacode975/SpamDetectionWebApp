Spam Detection Project
Overview
This project is a web-based application for spam message detection. It uses a machine learning model to classify messages as either Spam or Ham (Not Spam). The model is trained using a dataset of spam emails and then deployed via a Django application. The frontend allows users to input a message, which is then classified by the trained model.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for machine learning and backend development.
Django: Web framework for building the web application.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library used to build and train the spam detection model.
pandas: Data manipulation library used to handle the dataset.
HTML/CSS: Used for the frontend user interface.
Bootstrap (optional): CSS framework for responsive design.
Features
Spam Detection: Classifies input messages as either spam or ham using a trained machine learning model.
Web Interface: Simple and user-friendly web interface built with HTML/CSS where users can enter messages.
Prediction: Displays whether the input message is Spam or Ham based on the trained Naive Bayes model.
Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-detection.git
cd spam-detection
2. Install the required dependencies:
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file should include the following:

txt
Copy code
Django>=3.0
scikit-learn
pandas
3. Run Migrations:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
4. Run the Django development server:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Your application will now be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

How It Works
Dataset: The dataset is stored in the emails.csv file, which contains two columns: text (the message content) and spam (the label indicating whether the message is spam or ham).

Data Processing:

The CountVectorizer is used to convert text data into numerical data suitable for machine learning.
Model:

Multinomial Naive Bayes is used as the classifier to predict whether a message is spam or not.
The model is trained on 80% of the dataset and tested on the remaining 20%.
Prediction:

When a user submits a message through the form, the message is converted to a numerical format using the trained vectorizer, and the Naive Bayes model predicts whether it is spam or ham.
Frontend:

The frontend uses HTML for the form and CSS for styling.
After the user inputs a message, the result is displayed on the webpage, indicating if it is Spam or Ham.

Files Explanation
emails.csv: The dataset containing the messages and their respective labels (spam or ham).
home.html: The frontend HTML file where users can input their message and view the classification result.
views.py: This file contains the backend logic for handling form submission and prediction.
forms.py: Contains the form that collects user input.
urls.py: Defines the URLs and maps them to views.
How to Use the Application
Start the Django server with the command:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Open your browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
You'll see an input field where you can type your message.
Click Check to classify the message as Spam or Ham.
The result will appear below the input box.
Model Details
Model Type: Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
Accuracy: The model's performance was evaluated on the test set, and an accuracy score was calculated using accuracy_score from scikit-learn.
Future Improvements
Enhance UI: Improve the look and feel of the user interface to make it more engaging.
Real-Time Email Filtering: Extend the project to filter spam emails in real time from your inbox.
Model Optimization: Experiment with other machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) to improve classification accuracy.
